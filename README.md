# Automation-of-Pathology
This is our major project of MCA.
In this project we had tried to make a web based application by which the pathology and the user have the one-to-one intraction for the pathological report.
we had made the  two interfaces ie, user and client side inetrfaces.

In the client/user side interface we had given the details as:-
i) user registration
ii) user dashboard
iii) book appointments
iv) report preview

In the admin side interface we had given the details as:-
i) admin registration
ii) admin dashboard
iii) Test lists
iv) booked appointments lists
v) registered user lists
vi) additional settings

Now, we had made this in such a way that the client/user have the smooth and easy way to operate and function this.
We had given the privilaged to the  admin as it control all the operations of the client as well as the admin..

Hence, we had tried to give a web based application to reduce the cost of the  pathological reports.

Hope it will be easy to understand for others.ve
